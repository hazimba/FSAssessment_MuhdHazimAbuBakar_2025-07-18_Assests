the project applied with all my skills and knowledge, the project delivered more towards the functionality,
rather than design, even i believe i not deliver all the requirement,
but i quite satisfy with my work, at least i see where i am right now,
this is what you can expect from me for now,
and along the way of course there will more learning and upskill for me to self improvement and
contribute to company, appreciate for this opportunity.
